# Object-Oriented-Programming (Computer Accessories Sop)
e-commerce desktop application using Java.

Using object oriented methodology, user validation and text files to store data I programmed an 'online computer accesory shop' application,
which has been implemented using Java SWING (GUI).


The products and product information is stored in a text file which the programme reads and writes to.
A seperate text file  which the programme reads from stores the users of the online shop and their necessary information. A user can either be a shop 
customer or a shop manager, and depending on which type of user signs in, a diferent GUI will appear with functionality required for that user role.

A customer can view all product information excpept for the wholesale price, filter through products, add and empty products from their shopping baskets 
as well as checkout and pay for their basket items.

A Manager can view all product information and add new products for sale.
